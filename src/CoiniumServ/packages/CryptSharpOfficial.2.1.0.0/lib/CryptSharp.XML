             Variations of the Blowfish crypt algorithm.
             
             You only need concern yourself with Blowfish crypt variations if you have passwords
             generated pre-2011 using the C-language crypt_blowfish library or a port thereof.
            
             CryptSharp was implemented from specification and is not a port, and therefore never had the bug
             these variants pertain to.

            The $2a$ prefix indicates nothing about whether or not the crypted password was created with
            a pre-2011 version of the C-language crypt_blowfish library. Pre-2011, that library had a
            sign extension bug affecting non-ASCII passwords.
            
            See <see cref="F:CryptSharp.Utility.EksBlowfishKeyExpansionFlags.EmulateCryptBlowfishSignExtensionBug"/>

            or a port originating from it.
            
            If you have old crypted non-ASCII passwords you can't re-derive, and still want to verify them with CryptSharp,
            ensure that they have the $2x$ prefix instead of the $2a$ prefix. This will indicate to CryptSharp
            that it should emulate the bug when verifying the password.

            For passwords crypted with CryptSharp, this has always been true and as such selecting this

            Because crypted passwords take the form <c>algorithm+salt+hash</c>, if you pass

            <summary>
            The EksBlowfish code in CryptSharp was implemented as per the specification
            at http://static.usenix.org/event/usenix99/provos/provos_html/node4.html.
            
            Many other BCrypt implementations, however, are ports originating
            originating with the crypt_blowfish C implementation. Pre-2011, crypt_blowfish
            had a sign extension bug that caused up to three characters previous to any
            8-bit character to match 0xFF.
            
            CryptSharp never had this bug. However, for those who need backwards
            compatibility for old password databases created with one of these libraries,
            I have added *support* for the bug. You can enable it with this flag.
